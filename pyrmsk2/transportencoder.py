## \brief This class serves as a base class for a "thing" that knows how to "prepare" plaintexts before encryption
#         and reverse this preparation after decryption to reconstruct the original plaintext.
#
#  Children of this class are intended to be used to replace special characters in the input data that can not be
#  directly processed by the underlying rotor machine by characters or groups of characters that can be fed into the
#  machine and vice versa. The transformed plaintext is called the encoded plaintext.
