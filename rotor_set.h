/*! \brief A class that knows how to construct ::rotor and rotor_ring objects.
 *
 *  Apart from the desire for abstraction the main purpose of this class is to provide rotor machines with
 *  the possibility to use several sets of rotors. The rotor_machine base class offers methods that allow
 *  to add additional rotor_sets to be used when constructing rotors and rings. Each rotor and ring is
 *  assigned a numerical id. While all rotors and rings have to have different ids, it is normal to have
 *  a rotor and a ring of the same id.
 *
 *  One assumption when originally designing the interface of this class was that there is a one to one
 *  relationship between rotors and rings, as is for instance the case with the Enigma. The KL7 implementation
 *  broke that assumption because the KL7 has 13 rotors and 11 notch rings to choose from. In order to keep
 *  the class usable it is has been made possible to add "single" rotors or rings to the rotor_set. The price
 *  that has to be paid  for that is that a dummy rotor permutation (identity) or dummy ring data (all zeros) 
 *  is created for each single rotor or ring added to the set.
 *
 *  ToDo: This is a kludge that has to be removed. The main work lies in adapting the load and save methods.
