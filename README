This software aims to provide a framework to implement rotor machine simulators for the Linux operating system. Cryptographically accurate sample simulators for several Enigma variants and other rotor machines are included. The following machines are implemented by the program enigma:

    Enigma M4
    Enigma M4 with Schreibmax printer
    Enigma M3
    Wehrmacht or Services Enigma
    Enigma KD
    Abwehr Enigma
    Railway Enigma
    Tirpitz Enigma

And simulators for these machines are implemented by the application rotorvis:

    SIGABA (CSP889 and CSP2900 variants)
    Nema
    Typex
    Schlüsselgerät 39
    KL7

The file enigma_draw.h contains further information about dependencies and instuctions how to build rmsk2. This information can also be extracted through doxygen and is also contained in the wiki of this github repository.
