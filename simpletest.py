# \brief simpletest contains classes that together make up a primitive unit test facility.
#

## \brief This class serves as the base class for all unit tests.
#
#  Each test can be annotated with so called notes that can be used to convey information about
#  what happened when the test was performed. 
#
class SimpleTest:
    ## \brief Constructor. 
    #
    #  \param [name] Is a string. It has to specifiy a textual description for the test.

    ## \brief Returns the name given to this SimpleTest instance. 
    #
    #  \returns A string.
    #
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    ## \brief Performs the test defined for this instance of SimpleTest 
    #
    #  \returns A boolean. Return value True means that the test were successfull.

    ## \brief Add a note to this SimpleTest instance. 
    #
    #  \param [note] A string. This parameter has to contain a message that is to be associated with this
    #         SimpleTest instance.
    #
    #  \returns Nothing.
    #

    #         have been generated.

    #  \returns Nothing.

#         have been added to a CompositeTest instance.
