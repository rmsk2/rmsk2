 *
 *  In contrast to most other machines the Nema makes use of two different types of rotors. First there are the contact
 *  rotors that are used to scramble (or unscramble) the input data and then there are the drive wheels that have no
 *  electrical contacts but are used to control the stepping of the contact wheels through notches which are placed on
 *  their circumfence. Drive wheels are modeled as rotor objects which use the identity permutation and a rotor_ring
 *  that contains the notch data.
