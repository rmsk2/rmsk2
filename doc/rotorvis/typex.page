<title>About the machine</title>
<p>
The Typex was a cipher machine that was used by the UK during WWII and into first decades of the cold war. Cryptographically the Typex variant simulated by Rotorvis and the <link href="http://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/CSG/">CSG</link> is a
modified commercial Enigma machine without a plugboard. Like the Enigma the Typex has three moving rotors (the first three) and a reflector. Instead of a plugboard
the Typex has two additional rotors which can be set by hand but do not step during En-/Decipherment (the last two). Cryptographically these two rotors have the
same purpose as a plugboard: They prevent attacks which can be mounted when only the rightmost rotor of a machine steps most of the time. On top of 
that the rotors of the Typex step much more irregularly than those of the Enigma, because they have five (or even more) turnover notches instead of one or two
in the case of the Enigma. Another cryptographic advantage the Typex had over the Enigma is, that each rotor can be placed in two orientations
(normal, reverse) in the machine. There were several rotor sets for the Typex and these rotor sets could contain up to 240 rotors, which increased
the number of possible machine settings enormously. The Typex as simulated by Rotorvis looks like this:

Operationally the Typex has been improved heavily with respect to its Enigma cousin. The output of the machine is printed on a paper strip and one can not only encipher
letters but also numbers, punctuation characters and a blank character. This has been achieved by implementing a letters and a figures mode. The machine 
can be switched between these two modes by the buttons on the left below the paper strip (see also  <link type="topic" xref="elements#elem_buttons">here</link>).

<title>Configuration</title>
<p>
The configuration dialog for the Typex looks like this:

</p>
<p>There are the following configuration settings:</p>
<terms>
    <item>
        <title><code>Typex Rotor Set</code></title>
        <p>Typex was used with several rotor sets. In this field the name of the rotor set to use can be entered. Currently two values are allowed: defaultset and Y269,
        where defaultset corresponds to the rotor set named SP02390 in the Typex simulator of the CSG.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title><code>Typex rotors</code></title>
        <p>Determines which rotors are placed in the machine and in what sequence. There are seven (defaultset) or 14 (Y269) rotors (<code>a-g</code> or <code>a-n</code>).
        Each one of them can be placed in Normal or in Reverse orientation in the machine. Therefore for each rotor its designation and orientation 
        (<code>N</code> or <code>R</code>) have to be specified. Exactly five of the possible rotors have to be placed in the machine.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title><code>Typex rings</code></title>
        <p>Like Enigma rotors Typex rotors have a letter ring that can be set to 26 different positions with respect to the wiring core.
        The positions are designated by the letters <code>a-z</code>. Therefore this setting consists of five letters.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Typex reflector</code></title>
        <p>As with some Enigma variants the reflector of the Typex can be set in the field. The reflector is specified by 13 pairs of letters. In the
        example given above the pairs are: <code>ar by cu dh eq fs gl ix jp kn mo tw vz</code>. Each letter can and must occur once in this seting.</p>

<section id="typex_differences">
<title>Differences to the real machine and to other simulators</title>
<list>
    <item><p>In the real machine and in the simulator of the CSG the keys are labelled in such a way that the unshifted and shifted characters
    appear on top of each other instead of next to each other.</p></item>
    <item><p>The real machine and the CSG simulator do not contain a figure lamp (<link type="topic" xref="elements#elem_figure_lamp">see also here</link>). But
    operating the simulator is easier if one knows in which mode it currently is.</p></item>
    <item><p>The real machine and the CSG simulator do feature an additional FIG and a LET key on the keyboard to switch between the corresponding modes.</p></item>
    <item><p>When in figures mode the CSG simulator prints an apostrophe when the B or the N key is pressed. In my opinion it makes no sense to
    place the apostrophe twice on the keyboard and leave out the comma. I therefore assume that one of the apostrophes really is a comma. And
    so in Rotorvis the N key produces a comma when encrypting in figures mode.</p></item>

<section id="typex_interoperability">
<title>Interoperability with the CSG simulator</title>
<p>
Currently Rotorvis only implements the rotor sets designated <code>SP02390</code> and <code>Y269</code> in the CSG simulator.
