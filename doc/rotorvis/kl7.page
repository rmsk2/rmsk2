<section id="kl7_about">
<title>About the machine</title>
<p>
The KL7 was developed in the USA and entered service in the 1950's. It is therefore a "cold war machine". Even though it is much younger than the 
<link type="topic" xref="sigaba">SIGABA</link>, the cryptographic principles it uses seem to be less refined. One reason for this might be that the
USA shared this machine with its (NATO-)allies. The KL7 has eight rotors, seven of which step in a pseudorandom fashion. Stepping is controlled by
notch rings which are placed on the circumfence of the seven moving rotors. A feature the KL7 seems to have inherited from the 
<link href="http://www.maritime.org/doc/crypto/ecm/sec06.htm">Combined Cipher Machine (CCM)</link>. In the picture below the non-moving rotor is shown
with a dark grey background. An interesting feature of the KL7 is, that its rotors do have 36 instead of the usual 26 contacts. The additional ten contacts
are looped back inside the machine to the entry of the rotor stack. The electric signal therefore sometimes passes several times through the rotor 
stack.

Each KL7 rotor has a so called alhapet ring, which can be rotated relative to the wiring core. Even though alphabet rings have 36 positions only
26 of them are marked with a letter. The remaining ten positions are unmarked (empty). In the above picture the leftmost rotor is currently at one of these positions.
Each empty position is preceeded (and followed) by a position that is marked with a letter. This allows to reference all empty positions by adding a + sign to
the "lettered" position that preceeds ist. The empty postion which follows for instance the letter g is therefore designated g+.

<title>Configuration</title>
<p>
Here a pciture that shows the configuration dialog of Rotorvis' KL7 simulator:
</p>
<p>
<media type="image" src="kl7_config.png"/>
</p>
<p>There are the following configuration settings:</p>
<terms>
    <item>
        <title><code>KL7 Rotors</code></title>
        <p>Determines which rotors are placed in the machine and in what sequence. There are thirteen rotors to choose from (<code>a-m</code>).
        Exactly eight of them have to be placed in the machine and therefore a string consisting of eight letters has to be specified in this field. Each
        rotor can appear at most once in this string.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title><code>KL7 Alpha ring positions</code></title>
        <p>As mentioned above the alphabet rings can be rotated relative the wiring core. The position to which the alphabet ring is to be moved is a number
        between 1 and 36. Therefore this field has to contain 8 such numbers, each seperated from the preceeeding one by a space.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>KL7 Notch rings</code></title>
        <p>Determines which notch rings are attached to the rotors. There are eleven notch rings to choose from (<code>1-11</code>).
        Exactly eight of them have to be attached to the rotors in the machine. There is a 12th special ring, called the wide ring, which is always attached to the 
        non-moving fourth rotor. The remaining seven rings can be be chosen from the set of eleven mentioned above. This field therefore has to contain seven
        numbers between 1 and 11, each seperated from the preceeeding one by a space. Each notch ring can appear at most once in this field.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>KL7 Notch ring positions</code></title>
        <p>Determines to what positions the notch rings are moved after they have been attached to the correponding rotors. As the wide ring, which is always attached
        to the non-moving fourth rotor, can not be moved this field has to specifiy the positions of seven notch rings. Each position is either a letter between a and z or
        a letter between a and z followed by a + sign.</p>

<section id="kl7_differences">
<title>Differences to the real machine and to other simulators</title>
<list>
    <item><p>The real machine and the simulator of Dirk Rijmenants have some additional keys on the keyboard, including but not limited to a LTR and a FIG key, that have been 
    omitted in Rotorvis. Switching between letters and figures mode can be achieved in Rotorvis by pressing the corresponding buttons on the left side of the simulated machine.
    </p></item>
    <item><p>In the real machine and in the simulator of Dirk Rijmenants the keys are labelled in such a way that the unshifted and shifted characters
    appear on top of each other instead of next to each other.</p></item>
    <item><p>The real machine and the simulator of Dirk Rijmenants feature a mode switch which can be moved to the postions O = Off, P = Plaintext, E = Encryption and D = Decryption.
    The switch itself and the Plaintext mode, in which the KL7 can be used as a sort of typewriter printing on a paper strip, have been omitted from Rotorvis.</p> 
    <note><p>Operationally important is the fact that the machine's rotors step when the mode switch is moved from P to E or from E to P. Normally the rotors are set up
    while in P mode mode. When the setup is finished the mode switch is always moved to E (and maybe also from E to D) and the rotors therefore step once before the first
     character is typed. Rotorvis has the STEP button on the left side of the machine to achieve the same effect.</p></note>
    </item>
    <item><p>When the mode switch is moved from P to E or from E to P the real machine and Mr. Rijmenants simulator print a space character and the counter is incremented. Clicking 
    on the Rotorvis' STEP button only moves the rotors but neither generates an output character nor increments the counter.
    </p></item>

<section id="kl7_interoperability">
<title>Interoperability with Dirk Rijmenants simulator</title>
<p>
Rotorvis configuration information is very similar to the format used by Mr. Rijmenants simulator and can be translated back and forth in the obvious way.</p>
<note><p>It is important to remember to click the STEP button in Rotorvis before beginning to process a message in order to trigger the additional rotor stepping
which appears in the real machine whenever the mode switch is moved from P to E or from E to P.</p></note>
