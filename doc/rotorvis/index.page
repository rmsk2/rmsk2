<title>General information</title>

<p>Rotorvis is a cryptographically accurate simulator for several rotor machines. It aims to be complete 
in that sense that it implements all cryptographic and most operational features of the real machines. 
The graphics abstracts from the real appearances of the machines and is therefore not as detailed and
realistic as that of other simulators. The cryptographic correctness of the simulators can
be checked against other simulators which are known (or believed as not all machines have been fully declassified) 
to provide correct results. See for instance:</p>

<p>The links above lead to very interesting websites which are great resources for all things dealing with historic crypto 
equipment. While the author of Rotorvis recommends them, it has to be stressed that the author of this software is not affialiated
in any way with either of these sites.
</p>
<p>Rotorvis comes with full source code which allows everbody
to study in detail how the simulated machines work. This also opens up the possibility to maintain
the software even after the original author has lost interest in the project. Rotorvis has been written
using the <link href="http://www.gtkmm.org">gtkmm3</link> C++ toolkit for the Linux operating system and has been tested 
to run under Debian (Wheezy and Jessie) and Ubuntu (12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS). It is expected to work with any other modern Linux distrbution. 
Rotorvis provides simulators for the following machines:</p>

<section id="rotorvis_start">
<title>How to start the simulators from the command line</title>
<p>
From the command line the simulators can be started as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>./rotorvis &lt;machine_name&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
where <code>&lt;machine_name&gt;</code> can be <code>CSP889, CSP2900, Nema, KL7, Typex, SG39</code>. If you start Rotorvis without
any parameters a dialog is displayed that allows you to select the machine that you wish to simulate.

<section id="rotorvis_input">
<title>How to provide input to the simulator</title>

<p>You can use either the "real" keyboard of your computer, the simulated keyboard or the clipboard to provide input
to the simulator.</p>

<note><p>Some machines (KL7, Typex) have a letters and a figures mode when processing encryption input. The Typex 
for instance switches into figures mode when the <code>Z</code> key is pressed and switches back into letters mode when
<code>V</code> is pressed. When you type these special characters on the "real" keyboard of your computer while the machine
is in Encrypt mode they are ignored. You have to type <code>&gt;</code> on your computer keyboard to switch into figures 
mode and <code>&lt;</code> to switch back into letters mode. These special characters can be used independent of the type
of the simulated machine.</p>

<p>When a machine is in Decrypt mode then typing all characters on the "real" keyboard works as expected.</p>

</note>

<note><p>
It is possible to reach a state where a key on the simulator's keyboard is "stuck". This can for instance happen if you press a key on the
computer's real keyboard, keep it pressed while giving the focus to another application and after that release the key. In order to "unstuck"
the key press either the left or right shift key on your computer's real keyboard or press the stuck key again on your "real" keyboard after
the simulator has regained the focus.

<section id="rotorvis_menu_machine">
<title>The Machine menu</title>
<p>The Machine menu contains the following entries:</p>
<terms>
    <item>
        <title><code>Load settings ...</code></title>
        <p>Allows to restore the state of the simulator from a previously stored settings file. It is
        not possible to load a settings file when the machine type given in the seetings file does
        not match the machine type of the current Rotorvis instance.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title><code>Save settings as ...</code></title>
        <p>Allows to save the current state of the simulator in a so called settings file under a new file name.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Save settings ...</code></title>
        <p>Allows to save the current state of the simulator in a so called settings file using the current file name. If there is no
        current file name then a new one has to be specified.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Set rotor positions ...</code></title>
        <p>Opens a dialog which allows the user to change the rotor positions of the simulated rotor machine.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Configure machine ...</code></title>
        <p>Opens a configuration dialog which allows to set all the machine parameters for which there is
        no graphical representation in the simulator's GUI.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Show logs ...</code></title>
        <p>Opens a <link type="topic" xref="log_dialog">dialog</link> which allows to log input an output of the simulated machine. While the log dialog
        is not visible neither input nor output of the simulator is recorded.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Mode encryption</code></title>
        <p>Sets the mode in which the machine is operated, i.e. Encrypt or Decrypt. This setting also influences
        how input and output text is formatted (grouped) in the log dialog. For machines which use a lampboard as 
        an output device this setting only influences log output.</p> 
        <note><p>For machines which print output on a (simulated)
        paper strip changing the en/decryption mode also clears the paper strip.</p></note>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Randomize state ...</code></title>
        <p>Changes the settings of the machine to random values. Basis for random number generation is /dev/urandom so this is probably not
        cryptographically secure if your life depends on it but for having fun or doing some experiments it should be more than enough.
        The random settings are constrained by the randomizer parameter that is chosen by the user.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Rip paper strip</code></title>
        <p>For machines which print output characters on a (simulated) paper strip, this menu entry allows to
        "rip the paper tape". Or in other words: Remove all content from the simulated paper strip.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Process clipboard</code></title>
        <p>Processes the contents of the clipboard as if it had been typed on the "real" keyboard of your computer and
        replaces the clipboard contents with the produced output.</p>         
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Quit</code></title>
        <p>Unsurprisingly selecting this menu entry causes Rotorvis to be closed.</p>
