<section id="sg39_about">
<title>About the machine</title>
<p>
The Schlüsselgerät 39 or SG39 was a german cipher machine which was developed during the war but was never put into service. The information which was used to
implement this simulator has been taken from a document publshed by the NSA titled <link href="http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/german_cipher.pdf">German Cipher Machines of World War II, page 18 ff</link>. The following picture shows the Rotorvis simulation of the SG39:

</p>
<p>
The SG39 used four rotors, a rewirable reflector, a plugboard and three pinwheels. In Rotorvis the four rotors are shown on the left and the pinwheels on the right. Three of the rotors did step during en/decryption, the fourth rotor (the leftmost) could be set by hand but did not move. The three pinwheels in combination with additional pins on the rotors themselves, controlled the stepping of the rotors. The pinwheels stepped one position ahead with each character that was processed. In order to achieve a period of maximal
length the pinwheels had different sizes (21, 23 and 25 pins) which had no common factors.
</p>
<p> 
According to the above mentioned NSA document the Schlüsselgerät 39 had a dual printer, that printed the input characters as well as the output characters.
</p>
<p>When using an appropriate set of rotors the Schlüsselgerät 39 can be configured in such a way that it is compatible with an M4 Enigma and consequently with 
any other Enigma variant used by the german military during WWII (i.e. Services and M3). In order to make this possible fixed pins (one or two depending on 
the rotor) were added to each SG39 rotor which fulfill the same function as the turn-over notches on standard Enigma rotors (see <link href="http://chris-intel-corner.blogspot.de/2017/08/missing-page-from-ticom-i-137.html">TICOM I-137</link>). 
</p>
<p>Using other rotor sets it would be easy to additionally achieve at least partial compatibility with any Enigma variant that has a stationary or settable (but
not moving) reflector, i.e. any Enigma variant simulated by rmsk2 (including Typex) but not Abwehr. Full compatibility with KD could even be achieved in a more or less
obvious fashion.

<title>Configuration</title>
<p>
This picture shows the dialog which can be used to configure the SG39:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The following settings can be configured:</p>
<terms>
    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Rotor Set</code></title>
        <p>This field allows to select the rotor set which is to be used to configure the machine. Currently the following values are allowed: defaultset, M4Set. When using M4Set 
        the machine can be configured in such a way that it is compatible with an M4Enigma.</p>
    </item>   

    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Rotors</code></title>
        <p>Determines which rotors are placed in the machine and in what sequence. There are 10 rotors (<code>0-9</code>). For each rotor that is to be placed in the machine
        a designation has to be specified. Each designation may only appear once. The number of the leftmost (stationary) rotor has to be specified as the first character.</p>
    </item>   
    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Ring positions</code></title>
        <p>Determines the ring position of each of the inserted rotors. So this has to be a string of four characters each of which has to be in the range <code>a-z</code>. The first 
        character specifies the ring position of the leftmost (stationary) rotor.</p>
    </item>   

    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Reflector</code></title>
        <p>As with some Enigma variants the reflector of the SG39 can be set in the field. The reflector is specified by 13 pairs of letters. In the
        example given above the pairs are: <code>aw bi cv dk et fm gn hz ju lo pq ry sx</code>. Each letter can and must occur once in this seting.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Plugboard</code></title>
        <p>As with some Enigma variants the SG39 had a plugboard that permuted the input before entering and again after leaving the rotor stack. In this setting
        a permutation of <code>a-z</code> has to be specified. In the example shown above the permutation is <code>ldtrmihoncpwjkbyevsaxgfzuq</code>.</p>

        <title><code>SG39 Pins wheel 1</code></title>
        <p>This configuration element has to contain at most 21 characters which can be from the range <code>a-u</code>. Each letter
           corresponds to a set pin on the position specified by the letter.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Pins wheel 2</code></title>
        <p>This configuration element has to contain at most 23 characters which can be from the range <code>a-w</code>. Each letter
           corresponds to a set pin on the position specified by the letter.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>SG39 Pins wheel 3</code></title>
        <p>This configuration element has to contain at most 25 characters which can be from the range <code>a-y</code>. Each letter
           corresponds to a set pin on the position specified by the letter.</p>
    </item>    
</terms>

<p>The pin settings on the wheels and rotors do influence the rotor movements as follows:</p>

<p>1. With each letter, the three mechanical wheels, which had
lengths of 21, 23, and 25, moved forward one position each. If
the pin setting of any mechanical wheel happened to be in an
active position, the corresponding rotor would move one step
forward. If, for example, the pins on wheels 1 and 3 were in
active positions and the pin on wheel 2 was not, then Rotor 2
would remain stationary and rotors 1 and 3 would step. Rotor
4 was used as a stator, that is, its position was set at the
beginning of the message and it remained stationary
throughout the message.</p>

<p>2. In addition to the stepping caused by the mechanical wheels,
there was an additional independent stepping motion caused by
the Hagelin-type pins on the periphery of each rotor. If the
Hagelin-type pin on Rotor 1 was in an active position, it caused
Rotor 2 to automatically move one step forward. If the pin on
Rotor 2 was in an active position, it caused both rotors 2 and 3
to move one step forward. If the pin on Rotor 3 was in an active
position, it caused Rotor 1 to move one step forward. Rotor 4
had no stepping motion. If a specific rotor had been given one
step forward by the mechanical wheels and in addition was
independently "kicked" one step by the pins on the electrical
rotors, only one of these kicks would take effect.</p>

<title>Interoperability with other simulators</title>
<p>
As I am not aware of another simulator for this machine, there are no interoperability considerations.
