<title>General information</title>

<p>Keygen is a key sheet generator for all rotor machines which are supported by <code>enigma</code>, <code>rotorvis</code> and 
<code>rotorsim</code>. This software assumes that any key sheet
is intended for a named crypto net or machine key. A sheet is valid for one month in a given year and has always entries for 31 days even
if the month has only 30, 28 or 29 days. Key sheets also have a (pseudo-)classification level, which is shown on the sheet together with
other information. Key sheets can either be generated in HTML or TXT format. Here a screenshot of keygen's user interface:

        <title>Machine combo box</title>
        <p>This combo box allows you to choose a machine type for which a key sheet is to be generated.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Month combo box</title>
        <p>This combo box enables you to specify a month for which the key sheet is valid. If you select the alternative <code>Whole year</code>
        12 key sheets will be created and stored in the output directory. One for each month. The name of the month appears on the key sheet.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Year edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify a year for which the key sheet is valid. Allowed values for years are from the range 1900-2100.
        The year appears on the key sheet.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Classification edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify the (pseudo-)classifciation level of the generated sheet. This value will appear on the sheet.

    <item>
        <title>Crypto net/key name edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify the name of the key or crypto net for which for which the key sheet is valid. This value
        will appear on the sheet.</p>

        <title>Message Procedure combo box</title>
        <p>This combo box allows you to state the type of message procedure the newly generated key sheet will be used for. The parameters
        suitable for the selected message procedure (kenngruppen, basic rotor settings, ...) will then be added to the keysheet. The following 
        message procedures are currently known:</p>

                The operator chooses a random indicator which is sent in the clear to the receiver. The receiver uses the grundstellung
                to encrypt the indicator. The encryption result is then used as the rotor position for decryption (and obviously also for
                encryption).

                WWII after some point 1940. In effect it uses the ring setting as a sort of implicit grundstellung. The operator chooses two random
                starting positions for the rotors and uses the first to encrypt the second. After that the first and the encrypted second position
                are sent to the receiver who decrypts the second using the first and finally decrypts the message body using the decrypted second position.

                use of a daily basic setting (Grundstellung). The operator has to choose a random starting position for the rotors which is then encrypted 
                twice using the grundstellung.

<title>Machine types and sheet contents</title>
<p>This section lists the types of machines for which keygen is able to create key sheets. It also gives a short overview of the
contents of the generated sheet depending on the machine type. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the facilities which
can be used to set up the rotor machines in question.</p>.

        first moving the rotors and notch rings to the position specified by the Codewort. After that the indicators were encrypted. Finally the
