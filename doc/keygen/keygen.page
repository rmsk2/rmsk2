<title>General information</title>

<p>Keygen is a key sheet generator for all rotor machines which are supported by <code>enigma</code>, <code>rotorvis</code> and 
<code>rotorsim</code>. This software assumes that any key sheet
is intended for a named crypto net or machine key. A sheet is valid for one month in a given year and has always entries for 31 days even
if the month has only 30, 28 or 29 days. Key sheets also have a (pseudo-)classification level, which is shown on the sheet together with
other information. Key sheets can either be generated in HTML or TXT format. Here a screenshot of keygen's user interface:

<title>User interface elements</title>

<p> This section describes the elements of keygen's user interface.
</p>

<terms>
    <item>
        <title>Machine combo box</title>
        <p>This combo box allows you to choose a machine type for which a key sheet is to be generated.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Month combo box</title>
        <p>This combo box enables you to specify a month for which the key sheet is valid. If you select the alternative <code>Whole year</code>
        12 key sheets will be created and stored in the output directory. One for each month. The name of the month appears on the key sheet.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Year edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify a year for which the key sheet is valid. Allowed values for years are from the range 1900-2100.
        The year appears on the key sheet.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Classification edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify the (pseudo-)classifciation level of the generated sheet. This value will appear on the sheet.
        </p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Crypto net/key name edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify the name of the key or crypto net for which for which the key sheet is valid. This value
        will appear on the sheet.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Output format radio buttons</title>
        <p>These radio buttons can be used to select the output format, i.e. at the moment either HTML or TXT.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Save state files check box</title>
        <p>If you check this check box then state files that represent the settings for each day of the month are saved in the output directory.
        These files can be used to restore the corresponding machine state in order to initialize <code>enigma</code>, <code>rotorvis</code> or 
        <code>rotorsim</code>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>Output directory edit box</title>
        <p>This edit box enables you to specify the output directory where key sheets and state files will be stored. The browse button on the
        right can be used to select a directory through the file chooser dialog.</p>        
    </item>
    <item>
        <title>The Generate button</title>
        <p>Click this button to start the key sheet generation process. When sheets for a whole year are generated the progress bar on the top end
        of keygen's window will show the name of the month for which a sheet is currently generated.

<title>Machine types and sheet contents</title>
<p>This section lists the types of machines for which keygen is able to create key sheets. It also gives a short overview of the
contents of the generated sheet depending on the machine type. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the facilities which
can be used to set up the rotor machines in question.</p>.

        to generate a pseudorandom message key. The operator had to choose ten letters at random. These ten letters were sent in the clear along
        with the ciphertext as indicator groups. The rotor and notch ring positions for en- and decryption of the message were generated by 
        first moving the rotors and notch rings to the position specified by the Codewort. After that the indicators were encrypted. Finally the
        resulting ten letters were used as wheel and notch ring positions for en- or decryption of the message.

        It is created by first setting all control and cipher rotors to the O position. After that 30 A characters are encrypted. The final
        five letter group (containing the ciphertext for the 26th to the 30th A) is the check value. When pasting the rotor settings

        The final column contains a check value which can be used to verify the correct setup of the machine.
