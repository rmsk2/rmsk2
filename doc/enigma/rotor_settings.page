When opened via the "Rotor settings ..." menu entry this dialog shows all the rotor settings for the simulated Enigma variant.
In the case of the M4 it looks like this:

The number of rotors is different depending on the simulated Enigma variant. Apart from the M4 (which had five rotors including the reflector) 
all machines allowed four rotors (including the reflector) to be placed in the machine. In some variants the reflector or UKW (Umkehrwalze) also
had a ring that could be set. Where this is the case, the corresponding slider is not grayed out. The reflectors of the military variants
(M3, M4, Services) did not have a settable ring but one could choose from several reflectors (UKW B, UKW C, UKW D). All non military variants 
offered only one reflector. For each rotor position there is a drop down box that shows the rotors that can be used in this position.

Keep in mind that each rotor can be placed at most once in the machine.
