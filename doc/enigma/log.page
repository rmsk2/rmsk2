<title>General information</title>
<p>
When opened via the "Show logs ..." menu entry the log dialog shows all input and output characters generated by the simulated machine.
It looks like this:

<p>
The default grouping used when displaying input and output characters depends on the log style (Encipher/Decipher) and the simulated Enigma variant. 
The default grouping used in the Encipher mode mode is "No Grouping" for input and "Group by 4" or "Group by 5" for output. In Decipher log style it is the other way round.
The German Navy used four letter groups. The rest of the German military used five letter groups. Therefore for the naval machines M3 and M4 ciphertext is
always grouped by four characters.

<p>
The default grouping that is determined by log style and machine type can be changed at any time by clicking on the corresponding radio buttons. Text
that has already been entered in the Input or Output Log is reformatted accordingly.
