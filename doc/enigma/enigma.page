<title>General information</title>

<p>Enigma is a cryptographically accurate simulator for several variants of the famous Enigma cipher machine. Implementations for the
following variants are provided:

<p>The links above lead to the very interesting site <link href="http://www.cryptomuseum.com">Cryptomuseum.com</link> which is a great
resource for all things dealing with Enigma machines and other historic crypto equipment. While the author of Enigma recommends this and the
other great web sites mentioned in this document (<link href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/">Homepage of Dirk Rijmenants</link>
and <link href="http://cryptocellar.org/simula/index.html">Homepage of the Crypto Simulation Group</link>), it has to be stressed
that the author of this software is not affialiated in any way with either of these sites.
</p>
<p>Enigma comes with full source code which allows everbody
to study in detail how the simulated machines work. This also opens up the possibility to maintain
the software even after the original author has lost interest in the project. Enigma has been written
using the <link href="http://www.gtkmm.org">gtkmm3</link> C++ toolkit for the Linux operating system and has been tested 
to run under Debian (Wheezy and Jessie)  and Ubuntu (12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS). It is expected to work with any other modern Linux distrbution. 
</p>
<p>The simulated machines are drawn in the main window. There are several graphical elements which are used by Enigma.
<link type="topic" xref="enigma_elements">This page</link> describes them in more detail.
</p>
<p>You can use either the "real" keyboard of your computer, the simulated keyboard or the clipboard to provide input
to the simulator.</p>

<note><p>
It is possible to reach a state where a key on the simulator's keyboard is "stuck". This can for instance happen if you press a key on the
computer's real keyboard, keep it pressed while giving the focus to another application and after that release the key. In order to "unstuck"
the key press either the left or right shift key on your computer's real keyboard or press the stuck key again on your "real" keyboard after
the simulator has regained the focus.

<section id="enigma_start">
<title>How to start the simulators from the command line</title>
<p>
From the command line the simulators can be started as follows:
</p>
<p>
<code>./enigma &lt;machine_name&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
where <code>&lt;machine_name&gt;</code> can be <code>Services, M4, M4 Schreibmax, M3, Abwehr, Railway, Tirpitz, KD</code>. If you start Enigma without
any parameters a a dialog will appear, that allows you to select the variant to simulate. As an example the simulator for the M4 variant
looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<media type="image" src="m4_sim.png"/>
</p>
<p>
And as a further example here a screenshot of the M4 simulator using a Schreibmax printer:
</p>
<p>

<title>Compatibility with the real machines and other simulators</title>
<p>
Wherever possible the Enigma variants implemented by this simulator have been verified against real messages or simulators which are known to provide 
cryptographically accurate results. The reference implementations used for verification are:
</p>
<list>
    <item><p><link href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmasim.htm">Enigma simulator of Dirk Rijmenants</link></p></item>
    <item><p><link href="http://cryptocellar.org/simula/index.html">Enigma simulators of the Crypto Simulation Group</link></p></item>
</list>
<p>These simulators have been used to verify the implementation of the following Enigma variants in this simulator: M3, Abwehr, Tirpitz Services with Uhr
and Railway. In some instances (Services, M4) plain- and ciphertext of messages that have been prepared with the real machines are available and have been 
used to verify the correctness of this simulator.
</p>
<p>
The author of this software is not aware of simulators or real messages that make use of Umkehrwalze D (or Dora) and therefore any machine 
setting using Umkehrwalze D has to be considered unverified. The same is true for the same reasons for any setting of the simulator of the KD
variant.

<section id="enigma_menu_machine">
<title>The Machine menu</title>
<p>The Machine menu contains the following entries:</p>
<terms>
    <item>
        <title><code>Load settings ...</code></title>
        <p>Allows to restore the state of the simulator from a previously stored settings file. It is
        not possible to load a settings file when the Enigma variant given in the settings file does
        not match the machine type of the current Enigma instance.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
        <title><code>Save settings .../Save settings as ...</code></title>
        <p>Allows to save the current state of the simulator in a so called settings file.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Show logs ...</code></title>
        <p>Opens a <link type="topic" xref="enigma_log_dialog">dialog</link> which allows to log input an output of the simulated machine. While the log dialog
        is not visible neither input nor output of the simulator is recorded.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Log style: Encryption</code></title>
        <p>Sets the log style which is employed i.e. Encrypt or Decrypt. This menu entry only influences
        how input and output text is formatted (grouped) in the log dialog because in all Enigma variants there is no
        difference between operating the machine for Encryption or Decryption.</p> 
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Rip paper strip</code></title>
        <p>Allows to rip the paper strip of the simulated Schreibmax printer, i.e. clear the simulated paper strip. This entry is only shown        
        when the Schreibmax printer is in use.</p>
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Process clipboard</code></title>
        <p>Processes the contents of the clipboard as if it had been typed on the "real" keyboard of your computer and
        replaces the clipboard contents with the produced output.</p>         
    </item>    
    <item>
        <title><code>Quit</code></title>
        <p>Unsurprisingly selecting this menu entry causes Enigma to be closed.</p>

        <p>Opens a <link type="topic" xref="plugboard">dialog</link> which allows the user to choose the plugs on the Enigma plugboard. Only the military Enigma variants (Services, M3, M4)
        had a plugboard. A corresponding message dialog is shown when selecting this menu entry for a variant without a plugboard. Variants which were compatible with the
        <link href="http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/uhr/index.htm">Enigma Uhr</link> can be configured to use the Uhr through this dialog.

        <p>Resets all the settings available for the simulated Enigma variant to default values.</p>
