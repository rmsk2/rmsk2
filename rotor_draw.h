/*! \brief A GUI class that provides the graphical part of all simulators implemented by rmsk. 
 *
 *  The Enigma simulator and rotorvis main programs use this class as their interface to all aspects of the simulator that are drawn "by hand" 
 *  and are so isolated from the low level details.         
 *
 *  On top of that this class orchestrates the cooperation between the required and optional subelements. As a convention all children of the ::element  
 *  class delegate direct interaction with the event system of gtkmm to this class. 
 *  The main graphical elements of a rotor_draw object are the keyboard (member rotor_draw::keys), the 
 *  rotor stack (member rotor_draw::visualizer) and the lampboard or printer (member rotor_draw::lamps). On top of that additional (optional) elements are simulated 
 *  for instance a counter that counts the number of characters processed by the machine (member rotor_draw::char_counter), a "figure lamp" that indicates whether 
 *  the machine is in figures or letters mode (member rotor_draw::figure_lamp) and several buttons (members rotor_draw::lettrs_button, rotor_draw::figs_button, 
 *  rotor_draw::step_button). All graphical elements are children of the ::element class.
 *
 *  A rotor_draw object can either be in Encryption or Decryption mode. This mode can be queried by get_enc_flag() and set by set_enc_flag(). True means that the
 *  rotor_draw object is in Encryption mode. 
 *
 *  The output device (member rotor_draw::lamps) can be switched off or on. The current state (on/off) can be queried by get_lampboard_state() and set by
 *  set_lampboard_state(). This functionality has been implemented to speed up the encryption/decryption of longer texts, as not having to draw the output 
 *  symbols speeds things up.
