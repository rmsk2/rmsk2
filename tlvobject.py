    #  \param [method_name] Is a string. It designates the method which is to be called on the object named by
    #         the parameter obj_name.
    #    
    #  \param [tlv_params] Is a TlvEntry object. It specifies the parameters which are expected by the method named
    #         by the parameter method_name.
