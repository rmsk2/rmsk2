This software aims to provide a framework to implement graphical rotor machine simulators for the Linux operating system. Cryptographically accurate simulators for several Enigma variants and other rotor machines are included. The following machines are implemented by the program `enigma`:

    Enigma M4
    Enigma M4 with Schreibmax printer
    Enigma M3
    Wehrmacht or Services Enigma
    Enigma KD
    Abwehr Enigma
    Railway Enigma
    Tirpitz Enigma

Additionally simulators for these machines are implemented by the application `rotorvis`:

    SIGABA (CSP889 and CSP2900 variants)
    Nema
    Typex
    Schlüsselgerät 39
    KL7

A key sheet generator for all of the above machines is also provided. Further information and documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rmsk2/rmsk2/wiki) of this repository.
