/*! \brief A class encapsulating the concept of a stack of rotors in a rotor machine.
 *
 *  The variable rotor_stack::stack references the rotors that make up the stack. When encrypting the signal travels from the rotor 
 *  at position 0 to the rotor on position stack_size-1. In the default case the signal then leaves the rotor stack
 *  at a certain position which is the result of the encryption. The signal path is reversed when decrypting.
 *    
 *  If the flag rotor_stack::is_reflecting_stack is true, the signal is reflected back through the rotor stack. This is for 
 *  instance used in the Enigma simulator. The rotor on the last position in rotor_stack::stack is made the reflecting rotor. 
 *  In a reflecting stack there is no difference between encryption and decryption. A reflecting stack must contain at least two
 *  rotors. It is noted that the reflecting rotor does not have to be an involution. If one chooses a permutation that maps
 *  one character to itself, one could even have the simulated signal travel the same way back that it came from. If this happens
 *  a letter can represent itself in ciphertext. In a real physical rotor stack this is of course impossible even though a similar
 *  effect can be acheived with additional circuitry.
 *
 *  If the set rotor_stack::feedback_points contains elements it is checked whether the position where the signal would leave
 *  the stack is contained in the set feedback_points. If yes the signal is sent again through the stack in the same
 *  direction as before. This is repeated until an exit position is "hit" that is not contained in the set of feedback points.
 *  When decrypting the signal path is reversed. This is used in the KL7 implementation.
