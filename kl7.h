 *  Noteworthy about the KL7 stepping gear is that the rotors have a notch ring that can be chosen out of a set of
 *  11 rings *and* a letter ring. Notch rings and letter rings can be moved independently with respect to the wiring
 *  core. Therefore each rotor has a notch ring offset and a letter ring offset. The two offsets are modeled by adding
 *  corresponding mod_int_vals to the rotor_descriptor objects in use in the kl7_stepping_gear. Also worth mentioning
 *  is that the rotors of the KL7 have 36 contacts instead of the usual 26. The reason for that is that 10 contacts
 *  at the end of the rotor bank are looped back to the beginning of the bank. This increases the number of different
 *  rotor positions but still results in a permutation of the 26 letters of the latin alphabet.
