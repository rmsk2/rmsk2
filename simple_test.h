 *
 *  A unit test has a name and can be annotated with strings called notes. The notes are intended
 *  to communicate information about the test results to the user. The main method is test(). It
 *  is to be reimplemented by the children of this class and contains the actual test that is to
 *  be performed. If the test() method returns true, the test is assumed to have been executed
 *  successfully.
 *
 *  Why did I implement my own unit testing classes? Honestly, it seemed not appropriate to create
 *  a dependency to a more complex unit testing library just to satisfy the extremely modest needs
 *  of this project.
